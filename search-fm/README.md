A single page app to search for your favorite musical artist utilizing the last.fm api.
I built this app using ReactJS with hooks for state management.

The core functinalities implemented include the ability to search for your favorite's name which
will bring back relevant results including the artist and similarily named artist. 
Once the list renders a user may click in the "Info" link which will redirect to the artist's bio page on last.fm .


Future functions to add would include the ability to sort artists alphabetically through paging and sorting as well as searching within the page.

I would also add error messaging so that a user is aware when something has gone wrong. That can be done by using a conditional statement.
